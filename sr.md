## Project Overview

This is a playful interactive "forgiveness" website featuring cute kitten images. The site uses a multi-screen flow with animated interactions to create a sweet and humorous experience.

## Architecture

- **Single HTML file**: `index.html` serves as the main entry point
- **Embedded CSS**: All styles are inline in the HTML head for simplicity
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Interactive functionality is handled by embedded scripts
- **Static Assets**: Multiple kitten images (JPG/PNG) are used across different screens

## Key Features

- **Three-screen flow**: Initial screen â†’ Interactive screen â†’ Thank you screen
- **Button animations**: "Yes" button scales on hover, "No" button escapes mouse interaction
- **Visual effects**: Heart decorations, shadows, rounded corners for a cute aesthetic
- **Responsive design**: Flexible container sizing with mobile-friendly viewport
